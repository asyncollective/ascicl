# [ASCICL v3](http://asyncollective.org/index.php?pname=ascicl)

ASCICL is an internal UI framework for use at the asyncollective. It ensures consistency across asyncollective websites and provides a good specification for our design sensibilities. It is based on Bootstrap v2.3.2.

## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

ASCICL includes a [makefile](Makefile) with convenient methods for working with the framework. Before getting started, be sure to install [the necessary local dependencies](package.json):

```
$ npm install
```

When completed, you'll be able to run the various make commands provided:

#### build - `make`
Runs the LessC (not Recess because that generates blank code for some reason) compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs. Requires Less.js and uglify-js.

#### test - `make test`
Runs jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.

#### watch - `make watch`
This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running the makefile commands, be sure to first uninstall any previous versions (global and local) you may have installed, and then rerun `npm install`.
